    "- \"Kings and Queens\" is Killing Joke's third single from their fifth studio album, \"Night Time\". It was originally released by E.G.

E.G. also released a remix of the song, \"Kings and Queens (Knaves Mix)\", as an A-side and featured the same B-sides as the 12\" single of \"Kings and Queens\".\n",
